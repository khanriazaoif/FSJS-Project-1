Project Instructions
steps
Create an array of JavaScript objects to hold the data for your quotes.

-Name the array quotes.
-The quotes array should be accessible in the global scope, meaning it shouldn't be inside of a function.

Each quote object in the quotes array should have the following properties:

-A quote property which contains a string: the text of the quote that will be displayed on the page.
-A source property which contains a string identifying the creator of the quote. For example: "Mark Twain" or "Traditional Irish proverb.‚Äù
-An optional citation property which contains a string identifying where the quote comes from, like a speech or publication. For example, "Famous Anonymous Jokes." If there is no known publication, do not include this property on the object.
-An optional year property which contains a number identifying the year of the quote. For example, 1997. If there is no known year, then do not include this property on the object.

Create a function named getRandomQuote which:

-selects a random quote object from the quotes array.
-returns the randomly selected quote object.

Create a function named printQuote which follows these rules:

-printQuote calls the getRandomQuote function and stores the returned quote object in a variable.
-printQuote constructs a string containing the different properties of the quote object using the following HTML template:

<p class="quote"> [quote here] </p>
<p class="source"> [source here]
  <span class="citation"> [citation here] </span>
  <span class="year"> [year here] </span>
</p>

-printQuote only adds a <span class="citation"> if the quote object has a citation property.
-printQuote only adds a <span class="year"> if the quote object has a year property.
-printQuote displays the final HTML string to the page. You can use this JS snippet to accomplish that:

document.getElementById('quote-box').innerHTML
